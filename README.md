## Tips

1. **Storage Space**: Check your browser storage settings if you can't add more songs

5. **Organization**: Name your files clearly (shown as song title)

## Troubleshooting

**Songs won't play?**
- Check if the audio format is supported by your browser
- Try re-adding the song

**App doesn't work offline?**
- Make sure you opened it at least once while online
- Check if Service Worker is registered (F12 ‚Üí Application ‚Üí Service Workers)

**Storage full?**
- Clear old songs you don't need
- Check browser storage quota in settings

**Can't install the app?**
- Make sure you're using HTTPS (or localhost for testing)
- Try a different browser

## File Structure

```
music-player-pwa/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ index.html          # Main HTML page
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ styles.css          # Styling
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ app.js             # Player logic & IndexedDB
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ sw.js              # Service Worker (offline cache)
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ manifest.json      # PWA manifest
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ README.md          # This file
```

## How It Works

1. **Service Worker** caches the app files (HTML, CSS, JS)
2. **IndexedDB** stores your audio files as binary blobs
3. **Audio API** plays the files from local storage
4. **Media Session API** provides lock screen controls
5. Everything works offline after initial load!

## Development

Want to customize? The code is simple and well-commented:
- `app.js` - Main player logic, IndexedDB operations
- `styles.css` - All visual styling
- `sw.js` - Offline caching strategy
- `index.html` - Structure and layout
